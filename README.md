How To Play:
- Move your mouse around to select where you want to drop your fruit
- Click to drop the fruit
- 2 fruits of the same type combine
- Whenever fruits combine, you get more score
- The game ends when a fruit goes over the top of the basket

Cheat Codes:
- Press ESC to instantly end the game
- Press Q to override the drop delay, press Q again to turn it back to normal
- Press W to upgrade the fruit you are holding to a higher tier

Known Bugs:
- If you override the drop delay with the cheat code, you can lose the game if you spam fast enough
- Sometimes, fruits will start vibrating. This usually happens when:
    - The drop delay is overridden and fruits get spammed extremely quickly
    - The fruit stack is extremely tall
- When combining multiple fruits, the audio will cut into itself instead of playing over itself
    - This is due to Java's audio system
- Fruits occasionally spin in place
    - Complete visual bug, no effect on gameplay
